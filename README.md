## Project Overview

Small and medium businesses are frequent targets of phishing, malware, network intrusion, and payment fraud, but rarely have the budget or staffing for a dedicated security operations team. Existing tools tend to be either enterprise SIEM platforms priced and built for large security teams, or single-purpose consumer tools (one antivirus, one phishing checker) that never talk to each other.

Vanguard SME Security Suite consolidates five common attack-surface checks — file/malware, malicious URLs, network exposure, phishing email, and UPI payment fraud — into a single authenticated dashboard, then correlates the results into one running security posture score instead of five disconnected reports. High-severity findings are automatically escalated into incidents tagged against real MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.

This project was built as a portfolio/IEEE-track demonstration of full-stack security engineering — API design, authentication, threat-detection integration, and correlation logic — not as a production SOC platform.

## Key Features

### Core Detection

| Module | What it does | Backing technology |
|---|---|---|
| File / Malware Scan | Scans uploaded files for known malware signatures | ClamAV |
| URL Scanner | Checks URLs against reputation/threat databases | VirusTotal API |
| Network Scanner | Scans a target for open ports and exposed services | Nmap |
| Email / Phishing Analyzer | Validates SPF/DKIM/DMARC, flags lookalike domains and brand impersonation | Custom heuristic engine |
| UPI Fraud Check | Validates UPI handle format and flags known fraud patterns | Custom heuristic engine (format-level only) |

### Correlation & Posture

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Security Posture Score | Rolling trend score aggregated from historical scan results across all five tools |
| IOC Correlation Engine | Links related findings across scans and auto-escalates matches into incidents |
| MITRE ATT&CK Mapping | High-severity incidents are tagged with real ATT&CK tactic/technique IDs — verified working against live scan data |

### Explainability

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Detection Signals Panel | Expandable per-result breakdown showing the specific signals behind a verdict, rather than an opaque score |

### Access & Reporting

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| JWT Authentication | Token-based auth on all protected routes |
| Role-Based Access Control | Roles include SOC Analyst, Threat Hunter, Admin |
| Rate Limiting | Per-endpoint request throttling via SlowAPI |
| Text Incident Report Export | One-click plain-text report generation for any incident |

> **Note:** This project does not currently include enterprise features (multi-tenant orgs, SSO, SIEM integrations), trained ML/AI models, or scheduled/automated scanning. See Roadmap for what is intentionally out of scope today.

## AI & Automated Reasoning

This project does not use trained machine learning models or datasets. "Explainability" refers to structured, rule-based signal surfacing, not a predictive model. This is intentional scoping.

---

## Dashboard

| Widget | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Security Posture Score | Rolling score trend line from scan history |
| Recent Scans | Latest results across all five tools |
| Incidents | Auto-correlated incidents with MITRE ATT&CK tags |
| Detection Signals | Expandable explanation of triggering signals |

---

## Project Highlights

- Five independent detection tools unified behind one authenticated API and one posture score
- Real, verified MITRE ATT&CK mapping confirmed producing actual tactic/technique data from live scans
- Honest scoping: format-only UPI checks and text-only reports documented as limitations rather than glossed over

---
